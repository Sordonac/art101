	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures and File Transfer</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab is to introduce us to creating
		 a local file structure on our computer and create index.files.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>One difficulty that we had was our Art101 folder not showing up fully in Atom.
		After playing around with the file location, we were able to get it working.</p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>You are currently seeing the result of the index.html file that we created.
		Here is the file structure that we made:</p>
