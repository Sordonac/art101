						<h1>Garden of Eden</h1>
						<h2>Location</h2>
						<p>Heading up Highway 9, which is past the South Entrance to Henry Cowell State Park, you’ll reach a sign for the North Entrance to the park and on your right will be a dirt lot with two green metal gates. Enter through the southernmost gate and follow the trail down the hill. When coming across the fork, follow the path to the right until you reach railroad tracks. At the tracks, turn right and follow it until you see signs that say “No Campfires” on your left. Follow the steep trail and you’ll be able to hear the sound of the creek.</p>
						<h2>Description</h2>
						<p>Garden of Eden is a decently well-known hidden hotspot where students relax under the sun on sandy ground and swim in the creeks. It is a very clean environment with beautiful scenery making it the perfect place to relax on a sunny day.</p>
